There's two kinds of "access" data for the commands:
1. AccessLevel:
- private: command available only to specific users/guilds defined in the access config
- test: command available only to specific users/guilds defined in the access config for testing purposes
- public: command available to everyone

2. commandType:
- global: command available in all guilds where the bot is present
- guild: command available only in specific guilds
